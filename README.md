# Project-Phoenix
using Project Phoenix, you can control your Arduino board using Bluetooth or USB. You can generate ".ino" files from the application to upload it directly to the board.

This application needs Microsoft's remote-wiring which you can get from: https://github.com/ms-iot/remote-wiring/
